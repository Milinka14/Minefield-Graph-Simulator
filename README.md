This C program simulates a network of interconnected bombs using graph theory, where each bomb is a node connected to others within its blast radius. It reads bomb coordinates and explosion ranges from a file, builds an adjacency list to represent their connections, and provides interactive tools to analyze detonation effects. Users can trigger chain reactions (via BFS traversal), calculate blast coverage areas (using Monte Carlo estimation), and identify the most influential bomb in the network. The program also supports manual graph editing, including adding/removing nodes and edges, making it useful for both educational demonstrations and practical simulations of explosive impacts.
